## Inspiration and Development Journey

Suruchi was born out of a personal quest to find a meal planning application that truly met my needs. This project has not only filled that gap but also provided a platform to enhance my software engineering skills. Through Suruchi, I have embraced the MERN stack, honed my ability to document code, and learned the intricacies of project planning and software engineering best practices.
